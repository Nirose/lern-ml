As the new year starts, it's always a good to have a resolution. Some people make resolutions that are way out of reach which often leads to more distress than relief. Learning Machine learning has been on my learning list for a long while, but I've been putting it off because of many conflicting reasons  

I have some experience with Python programming and web development. I do not many algorithms and this is a first time I'll be delving in statistics computing. I haven't used maths since I've finished my college, so there will be a lot to cover still.

There are many online resources for learning machine learning and data science. The main defect is on the person not following through with the paths and lessons. I did start off on Data Science course on edX for some time where I learnt about Jupiter Notebooks and other python modules that deal with data manipulations. Other well-known resource includes YouTube and Udemy, However they are hit and a miss and lack professional direction. Udemy does have some proper formatting, controls and direction, but most of the better courses are paid which meant I couldn't access them.

The Data Science from edX was great but I couldn't complete it because of technical and personal reasons. My laptop was crap and the hard disk was failing, The fan was roaring like a speedster and it was headache inducing. 

I also have been trying to start a blog to keep me motivated through journaling and self-reflection. Hopefully, it will give me reasons to follow through with the learning. Work and personal reality will have preference over learning, but hopefully 2021 will be a better for everyone around us.  

To infinity and beyond
