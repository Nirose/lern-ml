blurb:
  heading: Why Machine Learning?
  text: Machine learning involves computers discovering how they can perform tasks
    without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning
    from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks
    assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the
    machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on
    the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can
    be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In
    practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop
    its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed
    step
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications,
    such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or
    unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. A
    subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics,
    which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine
    learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization
    delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
    learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory
    data analysis through unsupervised learning

    text: Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods,
      processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from
      many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data
      mining, machine learning and big data. Data science is a "concept to unify
      statistics, data analysis and their related methods" in order to
      "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques
      and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
      statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science.
      Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm"
      of science and asserted that "everything about science is changing because
      of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge

    text: Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve
      automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial
      intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample
      data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions
      without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms
      are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and
      computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop
      conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. A subset of machine
      learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on
      making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is
      statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers
      methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.
      Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data
      analysis through unsupervised learning
values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are
    trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use
    (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. For example, using
    job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a
    machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants
    against similarity to previous successful applicants. Responsible collection
    of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a
    critical part of machine learning.
